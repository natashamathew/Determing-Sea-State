# Determing-Sea-State
The IoT revolution has enabled the presence of billions of microprocessors with Internet access, allowing for the capturing
of sensor data and video camera feed, for later post-processing on a central server. In the Gulf of Mexico, 
the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA) has difficulty identifying the presence of 
choppy waters and potential security breaches, due to the vast expanses of water that need to be monitored.

In this research, we identify image processing techniques to use on buoy-based cameras in the gulf, demonstrating the 
advantages of edge processing for early identification of sea state on the Beaufort scale. Our experimental setup uses 
images captured from NOAA SCOOP buoy cameras positioned at 60Â° intervals. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of 
making sea state estimates at the edge, comparing against wind speed and wave height, thereby allowing smaller datasets
to be sent shoreside to the National Data Buoy Center.
